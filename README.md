## Light Police

Do your children call you the light police because you always tell them to switch off lights? Then this is for you! Install this app and then configure it to auto-switch-off lights!

* select the bulbs you want to switch off
* how frequent the patrol interval should be e.g. check and switch off every 5, 10 etc. minutes
* which illuminance lux sensor to use e.g. [Fibaro Motion Sensor](https://www.fibaro.com/en/products/motion-sensor/)  
* the lux level e.g. 50 plus is a pretty cloudy day.
